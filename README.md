# Hey there! I'm Charlie ðŸ‘‹
I'm a Bay Area software engineer, and I love building, breaking, and fixing things.

These days I'm working at [Verkada](https://verkada.com) on some cool new products!

## What I do
I'm most comfortable as a backend / ops developer, but in an ideal world I'd be working wholly full-stack, from front-end to bare-metal. There's something really cool to me about being able to help out wherever needed, and that drives a lot of my learning.

## What I've been up to
- Having discovered the pains of vanilla JS firsthand, I'm having a lot of fun finally getting up speed with [React](https://reactjs.org/) for some personal work.
- True to my ECE roots, I've been gravitating back towards the embedded Linux world again, with projects like [Yocto](https://www.yoctoproject.org/) to show me just how vast the space can be. At the same time, I finally have a use case to bust out some [Go](https://golang.org/)!
- Sick of hearing about GIL performance woes, I've been picking up ASGI frameworks like [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) and pretending to be a Node developer in Python with async/await syntax and the like.
- Still seeing how much time and money it takes before before I ditch the homelab setup and actually cloud host some things, but I just love Pis so damn much. And anyway, [k8s on the edge](https://k3s.io/) is a thing now.

## Take a look around :mag:
Lots of my work is still painfully infantile so I'm keeping it private for the time being, but I'm looking forward to open-sourcing some code soon! I can't promise universal usefullness to lots of my projects, but I'd love to open things up for collaboration or catch any bugs I might have missed.
