# Hello there! I'm Charlie ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software engineer based out of the San Francisco Bay Area, and I love fixing things with 1s and 0s.

Currently I'm working with [Plenty Farms](https://plenty.ag) towards revolutionizing modern agriculture! :seedling:

## What I do
I work a lot with all sorts of IoT and edge devices. Much of my time has been spent building infrastructure for managing these devices and developing applications on the edge. I frequently work with tools like Ansible, Docker, and MQTT that have been immensely useful to that end.

Along the way, I've become quite competent in Python and Java development building backing web services, and am having lots of fun diving into Javascript and Node.js!

I also love making life easier for fellow developers! At Plenty, I'm a member of the platform team, and work towards maintaining reliable distributed systems with minimal developer overhead.

## Take a look around :mag:
I aim to keep my projects as public as possible! Unless they're painfully new and unpolished or pose any sort of security/privacy concerns, you'll likely see it here. I can't promise they'll always be the most re-purposeable projects, but if you have any interest in contributing or referencing my code, feel free to shoot me a message or send me a PR!
